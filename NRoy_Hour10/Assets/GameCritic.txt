1. Is the game too easy or hard?
	I think its too hard because the player doesnt have much control in directing 	the ball toward the goal.
2. What would make it easier or harder?
	I think slowing the balls down would make it more managable.
3. What would give it a “wow” factor?
	Adding more visual effects, animations, and sounds so it's more intuitive.
4. What parts of the game are fun? What parts of the game are tedious?
	Some fun aspects include seeing the ball finally align with the corner. The 	tedious aspect if waiting for it to happen.
